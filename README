This application can be used to download Rally Scrum or Kanban data into a CSV file based on state chages stored in the revision log and creation dates of stories.

The config contains all projects to collect data for. Each project will have a separate CSV file created.

Be careful not to include spaces in commas in the kanbanStates element of the config as it will not match results returned from Rally. A correct config is below without spaces.

<kanbanStates>Input Queue,Analysis,Analysis Done,BVI in Dev/Test,Dev (Stories),Dev (Stories) Done,Test (Stories),Test (Stories) Done,Integration,Release Ready,Release Ready Done,Released</kanbanStates>

Rally has a ready flag for each state, if you want to see dates for when an item is marked as ready in a state, add an extra state with " Done" appended to the end e.g.

Analysis
Analysis Done

This will record both the Analysis timestamp and when ready was marked whilst in Analysis (stored in Analysis Done column).
